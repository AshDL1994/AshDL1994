## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Ash, I am a graduate of the Northcoders Data Engineering Bootcamp. Welcome to my GitHub profile! 

The course covered a variety of topics before culminating in a three week group project involving loading data from a data lake into
a data warehouse hosted in AWS.

The majority of my repos are corresponding to a sprint/topic from the bootcamp, as well as the final group project which you can read more about [here](https://github.com/AshDL1994/HyperProject). 

If you have any questions about the content on my profile and/or my journey into tech so far, feel free to pop me a message on Linkedin :)
